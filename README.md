# Botium Toys Internal Security Audit

This project is part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** on Coursera. It involves conducting a mock internal security audit for **Botium Toys**, a fictional toy company, to assess their security posture, controls, and compliance with standards like PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC.

## Overview
- **Scope**: Entire security program, including all assets, processes, and compliance practices.
- **Goals**: Assess assets, complete controls and compliance checklists, and recommend improvements to reduce risks.
- **Risk Score**: 8/10 (high due to missing controls and weak compliance).

## Key Activities
- Reviewed the **Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report**.
- Completed the **Controls Assessment Checklist** to evaluate implemented security controls.
- Completed the **Compliance Checklist** for PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC standards.
- Provided recommendations to improve Botium Toys' security posture.

## Key Findings
- **Implemented Controls**: Firewall, Antivirus, Locks, CCTV, Fire detection/prevention.
- **Missing Controls**: Least Privilege, Separation of Duties, Encryption, IDS, Backups, Password Management.
- **Compliance**: Partial compliance with GDPR (notification plan and privacy policies in place); weak compliance with PCI DSS and SOC due to lack of encryption and access controls.

## Recommendations
- Implement **Least Privilege** and **Separation of Duties** to restrict access to sensitive data.
- Use **Encryption** for credit card information.
- Establish a **centralized password management system** with strong complexity requirements.
- Develop **disaster recovery plans** and regular **backups**.
- Install an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**.
- Classify and inventory assets for better management.
